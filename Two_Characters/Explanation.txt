We first want to create a set of unique characters that we want to iterate over while constructing out unique sets. We still want do unique traversals so indexes is necessary. 

ex. For set [A,B,C,D], we want to traverse: 

A B 
A C
A D
B C
B D
C D

We iterate through these permutations, and process a count which tells us how much that iteration generates. 

Func process will give me nil if the string turns out to be invalid. Figuring out whether or not it is invalid is done in a string extension where it matches to a regex.
